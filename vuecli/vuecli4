URL Transform Rules
If the URL is an absolute path (e.g. /images/foo.png), it will be preserved as-is.

If the URL starts with ., it's interpreted as a relative module request and resolved based on the folder structure on your file system.

If the URL starts with ~, anything after it is interpreted as a module request. This means you can even reference assets inside node modules:

<img src="~some-npm-package/foo.png">
If the URL starts with @, it's also interpreted as a module request. This is useful because Vue CLI by default aliases @ to <projectRoot>/src. (templates only)
