Changing boot configuration
By default, your Jenkins runs at https://localhost:8080/. This can be changed by editing jenkins.xml , which is located
in your installation directory. This file is also the place to change other boot configuration parameters, such as JVM
options, HTTPS setup, etc.

Starting/stopping the service
Jenkins is installed as a Windows service, and it is configured to start automatically upon boot. To start/stop them
manually, use the service manager from the control panel, or the sc command line tool.

Inheriting your existing Jenkins installation
If you'd like your new installation to take over your existing Jenkins data, copy your old data directory into the
new JENKINS_HOME directory.
